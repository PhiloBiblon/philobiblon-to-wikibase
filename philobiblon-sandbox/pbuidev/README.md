# Configure pbuidev

Configuration of pbuidev instance in Wikibase Cloud: https://pbuidev.wikibase.cloud

In order to work with pbuidev we need run two extra services:
 - [OpenRefine reconciler server](./reconcile/README.md). In order to be able to reconcile with OpenRefine.
 - [QuickStatements](./qs/README.md). Updated QuickStatements server with new features added in upstream version and not included yet in QuickStatements Wikibase Cloud.
